## Development Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. Create virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
   pip install -e ".[all]"
   ```
3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
4. Write your code
5. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   cd frontend && npm test
   ```
6. Ensure your code follows our style guidelines
7. Submit the pull request

## Coding Style

### Python

* Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
* Use type hints where possible
* Write docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods
* Keep functions focused and single-purpose
* Comment complex algorithms and business logic

### TypeScript/React

* Follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
* Use functional components with hooks
* Keep components small and focused
* Use TypeScript interfaces for prop types
* Write meaningful test cases

### Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  * üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
  * üêé `:racehorse:` when improving performance
  * üö± `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
  * üìù `:memo:` when writing docs
  * üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
  * ‚ú® `:sparkles:` when adding a new feature

## Testing

### Backend Testing
